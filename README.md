# Simple_Table_Extraction
Simple OpenCV/Tesseract script that uses optical character recognition to extract a data table from a .jpeg then writes it to an excel file

# Usage
$ python get-table.py path/to/image/with/table

# Notes:
This is my first application of computer vision! It was a POC I built for work.
OpenCV works well to preprocess images for optical character recognition with Tesseract.
So, the image should ideally be a .jpg and should have a simple table without any whacky characters.
There are many ways I could fine tune this script to perform OCR more accurately, but I had to move on to another project for work.
I will add more CV scripts cuz it's very fun!
